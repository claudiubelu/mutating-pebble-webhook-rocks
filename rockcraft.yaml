description: |
    A rock containing the Pebble Mutating Webhook.

    Pebble needs to be able to write in the $PEBBLE folder (/var/lib/pebble/default
    by default) in order to write its state file and a few other files. However,
    there are scenarios in which Pods are deployed with readOnlyRootFilesystem
    SecurityContext, blocking Pebble from writing its state file.

    This admission webhook for Kubernetes Pods will add an empty dir volume for
    containers with `readOnlyRootFilesystem=true` containers for Pebble to write in,
    and set / amend the `$PEBBLE` and `$PEBBLE_COPY_ONCE` environment variables
    appropriately.
